## Netguru Free RoR Workshops in Wroc≈Çaw

This is a Ruby on Rails challenge set by [Netguru](https://netguru.co/) as a means to qualify for their periodic workshops. I took up this test as a way to learn (trust me I did!) and foster my maturity as a Rails dev.

[On this page](https://tranquil-ocean-5009.herokuapp.com) you can find my completed version of the challenge app hosted on Heroku.
